I travel frequently for work, and have spent many years subjected to office and hotel coffees that just plain bum me out. I finally decided that I had had enough and set out to put together a travelling coffee setup. This is the result of that quest.

== What I Look for in a Travel Kit



== Parts and Pieces

I would like to talk a bit about the process I went through when choosing the things that went in this kit. Hopefully this will help you make some decisions on your own kit, whether or not you use the same things I used.

=== Aeropress

The aeropress is a no-brainer as the brewer for a travel kit. It's compact, its made of durable plastic, and above all, it's an immersion brewer. Immersion brewing means the grounds are steeped in hot water for an amount of time, as opposed to pourover brewing, where water passes through ground coffee in a filter of some kind. For a travel kit, the immersion method has several advantages.

- Immersion brewing does not require a fancy gooseneck kettle for precision pouring.
- Immersion brewing is more forgiving of small changes to brew ratios. Since I don't have a gram scale available on the road, I want to have some flexibility in my recipe.
