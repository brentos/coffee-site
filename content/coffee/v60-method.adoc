I bought my clear plastic link:https://www.hario.jp/[Hario v60] for $6 to take on a camping trip in 2011, and now years later is my go-to brewer. It is one of the best brewer options for any coffee with lighter body and fruit notes. Lately I've been using a cloth filter from link:http://coffeesock.com/[CoffeeSock] instead of the typical Hario paper filters.

== Specs

- **Coffee**: 18 grams
- **Grind**: Medium; _15F - 16D on the Baratza_
- **Water**: 324 grams
- **Water Temp**: 203&#8457;
- **Total Time**: 3:30

== Notes

1. Preheat and pre-wet your filter and mug with 150g - 200g of water.
+
_TIP #1: Don't be an idiot, dump out your water_
2. Add your ground coffee to the filter and shake it to even it out.
3. Bloom. Start your timer and quickly pour out 40 - 50 grams of water. You want to make sure to agitate everything enough that it settles evenly.
4. Pour. Start at 0:55 and pour as slowly as possible, from the middle out. You're aiming to hit 324 right at 2:30.
+
_TIP #2: Be sure to hit the grounds on the edge, but don't hang out there too long._
5. Allow a draw down for about a minute.
6. Get a sip of the good stuff.
