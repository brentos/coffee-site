I bought my clear plastic link:https://www.hario.jp/[Hario v60] for $6 to take on a camping trip in 2011, and now years later is my go-to brewer. It is one of the best brewer options for any coffee with lighter body and fruit notes. Lately I've been using a cloth filter from link:http://coffeesock.com/[CoffeeSock] instead of the typical Hario paper filters.

== Specs

* **Coffee**: 22 grams
* **Grind**: Medium-fine; _13D on my Baratza Preciso_
* **Water**: 360 grams plus extra for heating the filter and mug
* **Water Temp**: 204&#8457;
* **Total Time**: about 3:00

== Notes

1. Preheat and pre-wet your filter and mug with 150g - 200g of water.
+
_TIP #1: Don't be an idiot, dump out your water_
2. Add your ground coffee to the filter and shake it to even it out.
3. _Bloom_. Start your timer and quickly pour out 65 -75 grams of water.
+
Gently mix the grounds and water so that all of the grounds get wet as quickly as possible.
4. _Pour_. Start at 0:45 and pour gently but quickly, filling the brewer, until you reach 360 grams.
+
_TIP #2: Be sure to hit the grounds on the edge, but don't hang out there too long._
5. Allow a draw down until about 3:00
6. Get a sip of the good stuff.
